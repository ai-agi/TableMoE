# TableMoE

**TableMoE** is a powerful multimodal large language model built upon a novel <strong>Mixture-of-Connector-Experts</strong> (MoCE) architecture. It is designed for robust table-centric understanding and visual reasoning across diverse formats, including text, tables, charts, and images. Trained on extensive tabular corpora, TableMoE supports advanced tasks such as table editing, highlighting, replotting, transformation, and symbolic CoT-driven or PoT-driven reasoning. Its symbolic routing and expert composition enable strong conversational capabilities grounded in structured data.

## News
- **`2025/06/02`**: 🌍 We release **WMMFinanceMath**, see [**here**](https://github.com/ai-agi/WMMFinanceMath ), a visually grounded version of FinanceMath with markdown tables rendered into WildStruct-style images featuring real-world noise like blur, skew, and watermarks. 🎉
- **`2025/05/05`**: 🎉🎉🎉 TableMoE extends the LLaVA-NeXT framework (https://github.com/LLaVA-VL/LLaVA-NeXT) by implementing new functionalities that enable encoding multiple images within multi-round conversations in a single sample per batch—capabilities not supported in the original implementation!
- **`2025/05/01`**: 🚀 We release TableMoE!
